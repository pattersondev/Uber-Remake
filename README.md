# Uber-Remake

By far the hardest and most fun project I have done thus far. Big shoutout to Sonny Sangha who helped make this project a lot easier. 

In this project I used the following:
React
React native
Tailwind
React Redux
React Nanigation
Google Directions API
Google Matrix API
Google Places API.

This project all in all was just a lot of fun to do.
